# Newline

## Features

Whenever you save a file, this extension will automatically add a blank line at its end, if there isn't one already. If you have multiple blank lines, only one will be kept.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `newline.fileExtensionsToIgnore`: List of file extensions to which blank lines should not be added.
* `newline.ignoreOnlyNewlinesFile`: Ignore files only have newlines
